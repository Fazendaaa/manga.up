      You can see it as a podcast player, where it looks for content in
      the server hosted by the podcast creator itself and you choose the
      player from your liking. Just like that,
      <strong>manga.up</strong> is a "player" where the content is not
      stored in itself but fetched from another source.

      In case that you want to have your own version of
      <strong>manga.up</strong> as a self-hosted option, please take a
      look at our about page:
