      If you have an old tablet laying around or even want to buy and old one
      just to read mangas; this app is meant to help you. We all have been
      there wanting to read all the mangas but find to troublesome to binding
      read in the laptop screen and too uncomfortable to read at the
      smartphone. If you add this website in your smartphone you will be able
      to receive the notifications and read right at moment or just open the
      same website later on in your tablet or PC at home to read it.

      Besides helping you stay focus and up to date in your favorites the idea
      behind <strong>Manga.up</strong> is also to act like an true
      application, by default the user won't need to send us any kind of
      information, your data will be encrypted and stored in your device and
      your device only it will be able to ever hold your data.

      As <strong>Manga.up</strong> acts kind a true app, even tho if you are
      online, for now there's syncing user content to our servers. So, if you
      ever loose your data, that's on you!
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea is to connect the user data to their preferred cloud provider
      so that data can stay safe there.

      Even though <strong>Manga.up</strong> focus mainly in manga content --
      hence the name --, in a non so distance future, the idea is o implement
      or even support self-hosted content servers; that way
      <strong>YOU</strong>, the user, can host your own content and consume it
      from anywhere, share it with your loved ones and maintain alive the
      memory of those incredible histories.
